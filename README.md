# TaskFlow

A full-stack task management application built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). TaskFlow supports role-based access control, team collaboration, and a clean modern UI.

---

## Features

- **Role-based access** — Manager, Team Lead, and Employee roles with different permissions
- **Task management** — Create, edit, delete, and reassign tasks via modals (no page navigation)
- **Status tracking** — Toggle task status between Pending and Completed; sort by status in the task list
- **Team collaboration** — Managers assign tasks to any user; Team Leads assign within their team
- **User activation flow** — New users register as inactive and are activated by their referenced manager or team lead
- **Pagination** — Task list paginated with smart ellipsis page numbers
- **Modern UI** — Bootstrap 5 + Bootstrap Icons, split-panel auth pages, dark navbar, colored role badges

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node index.js
